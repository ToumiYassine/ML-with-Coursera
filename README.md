# ML-with-Coursera
Final Project: Classification with Python

In this notebook, i have practiced all the classification algorithms that we have learned in this course.

Below, is where we are going to use the classification algorithms to create a model based on our training data and evaluate our testing data using evaluation metrics learned in the course.

We will use some of the algorithms taught in the course, specifically:

Linear Regression
KNN
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
SVM
We will evaluate our models using:

Accuracy Score
Jaccard Index
F1-Score
LogLoss
Mean Absolute Error
Mean Squared Error
R2-Score
Finally, I used models to generate the report at the end.
